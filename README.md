### Investment Outlook

This package takes the data from our databank, transforms it into individual dictionaries and then uses the dictionaries as inputs for python's pptx package. The graphs are not perfectly formmatted for maintaince reasons.

This package is only used once per quarter and we don't need to be perfect. We just need the data to be inserted in powerpoint. Also for simplicity, I divided each market in their own independet script.

The data formatting is done at the beggining of each script to make it self-contained. I could create a single script for data formating and export pikle files to then load them into each script, but that is the next version.

1. You got to change the name of the presentation template to "Canadian_report_template_2.pptx"
2. You have to change the slide number from "5" to "4"

Enjoy!
